# REACTLESS

## Intro
Reactless is [React.js](https://react.dev/), striped to it's essentials

This whole adventure started with a simple goal: to peek under the hood of React, demystify its inner workings.

If you've ever wanted to truly understand what makes React tick, you're in the right place.

## Install the dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

## Fire it up

```bash
bun run --hot index.ts
```

The app.tsx file is your primary canvas.

DON'T STOP THERE, console.log the shit out of reactless code, bomb gpt, or better, yet DM ME. 

Modify it, break it, and rebuild it
